Hey,

I'm Simon HEGE, a software engineer based in Grasse, France. I love  discovering
new technologies and challenges (for sure in computer science, but also while cooking or on my road bike).

I started coding at 12, automating creation of calendar thanks to Excel macros in VBA.
I then discovered the web and javascript (at a time when neither Google nor jQuery existed).
I studied aeronautics and computer science at ENAC (French Civil Aviation University).

Thanks to side projects or regular job, I learned fantastic technologies, such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, C++, Go, ReactJS, ...
I used them in various contexts, such as aeronautical data management, cartography, accounting, data vizualisation.

I was brought to contribute to projects such as:

* [GDAL/OGR](http://www.gdal.org/) a C++ library allowing to interact with geographical vector datasources
* [Path4Flight](http://www.path4flight.com/) especially on the IA based trajectory generator web app for Helicopter Emergency Medical Services
* [dex](https://github.com/coreos/dex/) a federated OpenID Connect provider
